Pebble watch app/server example using web sockets.


### Instructions

#### Server
1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`


#### Watch App
1. Using [Cloud Pebble](http://cloudpebble.net) copy the watch-app.js code to a new project
2. Update the IP in the app to point to your server running node
3. Install the app to the watch


Once the app is installed and talking to the server you will see a "Hello" appear on the watch.  Now anything you type
 in the shell where you are running the server app will be sent to the watch and displayed on the screen.
